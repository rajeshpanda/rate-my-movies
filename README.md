# rate-my-movies
Python script to rate your local drive movies by fetching details from _api.themoviedb.org_

## What does it solve?
Have a massive collection of old movies which you got from a/many torrent link(s) but, have no clue what to watch?
This is where you can use this utility and get a csv where the ratings would be put against the movie names. Makes it just easier to watch better movies first ;)

## How to run it?
Just open a terminal or command prompt and go to the location where you have _rate_my_movies.py_.
Run `python rate_my_movies.py <path to your movies folder>` and find your result in a csv in _Output_ folder.
